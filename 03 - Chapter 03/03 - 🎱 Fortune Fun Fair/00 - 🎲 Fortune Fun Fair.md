# üé≤ Fortune Fun Fair: Spin the Wheel with Random!

Welcome to the **Fortune Fun Fair**, where your Python programs become carnival showstoppers, using the **random** module to add surprises! üé° In **Chem-Craze-Carnival**, you used `if`/`elif` to compare values‚Äînow you‚Äôll harness `random.randint()` to make unpredictable choices, like picking a prize or spinning a wheel. These examples will show you how to import modules and generate random numbers. Let‚Äôs roll the dice! üé∞

## üìñ What Is the Random Module?

A **module** in Python is like a carnival booth‚Äîit‚Äôs a file full of tools (functions) you can use in your program. The **random** module, part of Python‚Äôs standard library (over 200 modules!), provides functions for randomness. The `randint(a, b)` function generates a random integer from `a` to `b` (inclusive), perfect for games or surprises.

**Basic Syntax**:

```python
import random
number = random.randint(1, 5)  # Random integer from 1 to 5
```

**Key Rule**: Use **2-space indentation** for code inside `if` statements (like in Chem Craze Carnival) to avoid SyntaxError or IndentationError (see Bug Buster Bonanza).

### Example 1: Carnival Prize Picker

```python
# Picking a carnival prize
import random
prize = random.randint(1, 3)
if prize == 1:
  print("You won a teddy bear!")
if prize == 2:
  print("You got a balloon!")
if prize == 3:
  print("You scored a keychain!")
```

**How It Works**:

- `import random` loads the random module.
- `random.randint(1, 3)` picks a number from 1 to 3.
- `if` statements check the number and print a prize (e.g., if `prize` is 2, prints ‚ÄúYou got a balloon!‚Äù).
- Each run gives a different prize randomly.

**Output** (example): `You scored a keychain!`

### Example 2: Wheel of Fortune Spin

```python
# Spinning a carnival wheel
import random
spin = random.randint(0, 4)
if spin == 0:
  print("Jackpot! Win a giant plush!")
if spin == 1:
  print("Free cotton candy!")
if spin >= 2:
  print("Try again tomorrow!")
```

**How It Works**:

- `random.randint(0, 4)` picks a number from 0 to 4.
- `if` statements use `==` and `>=` (from Chem Craze Carnival) to decide the outcome.
- `spin >= 2` covers 2, 3, or 4, increasing the chance of ‚ÄúTry again‚Äù.

**Output** (example): `Free cotton candy!`

**Knowledge Nugget**: `randint(a, b)` includes both `a` and `b`, so `randint(1, 3)` can return 1, 2, or 3. Each number has an equal chance (e.g., 1/3 for three options). Python‚Äôs `random` module uses a pseudorandom number generator, which is great for games but not secure for cryptography‚Äîstick to carnival fun!

### Example 3: Fortune Teller Bot

```python
# Predicting your carnival day
import random
question = input("Ask a question about your day: ")
luck = random.randint(1, 4)
if luck == 1:
  print("A thrilling day awaits!")
if luck == 2:
  print("Expect a sweet surprise!")
if luck == 3:
  print("Adventure is around the corner!")
if luck == 4:
  print("Relax and enjoy the rides!")
```

**How It Works**:

- `input()` gets a question (from Chatty Code Craze).
- `random.randint(1, 4)` picks a number from 1 to 4.
- `if` statements select a unique prediction.
- The question is echoed, but only the prediction is printed.

**Terminal View** (example):

```
Ask a question about your day: Will I have fun?
Relax and enjoy the rides!
```

**History Lesson**: Python‚Äôs `random` module, introduced in 1991, was inspired by scientific computing needs for simulations (like Monte Carlo methods). Modules like `random` make Python extensible, letting you import tools without writing them yourself. The idea of modules dates back to 1960s languages like Modula, but Python‚Äôs `import` is super noowbie-friendly!

## üí° Tips for Random Success

- **Import First**: Always `import random` before using `randint()`, or you‚Äôll get a NameError (see Bug Buster Bonanza).
- **Check Range**: `randint(a, b)` includes `a` and `b`. Double-check your range (e.g., 1 to 9 means 9 possible numbers).
- **Test Randomness**: Run your code multiple times to see different outputs. Each run is a new roll!
- **Simplify with If**: For multiple outcomes, `if` statements work fine for beginners. Later, you‚Äôll learn lists or `elif` (from Chem Craze Carnival) to streamline.
- **No Elif Needed**: This topic uses simple `if` statements since each `randint()` outcome is unique, but `elif` could work too.

## üéØ What‚Äôs Next?

You‚Äôre ready to predict the future! Head to the Exercises folder to create a `magic8.py` program that builds a Magic 8 Ball with `random.randint()`. Ask it questions and watch the answers roll in! üé±

**Quick Challenge**: What‚Äôs a possible output if `ticket` is random?

```python
import random
ticket = random.randint(1, 3)
if ticket == 1:
  print("Free popcorn!")
if ticket == 2:
  print("Ride voucher!")
if ticket == 3:
  print("Game token!")
```

Try it in the exercises!
