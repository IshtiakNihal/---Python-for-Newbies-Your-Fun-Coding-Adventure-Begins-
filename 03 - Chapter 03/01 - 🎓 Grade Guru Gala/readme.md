# 🎓 Grade Guru Gala: Shine with If/Else Statements!

Welcome to the **Grade Guru Gala**, the second stop in Chapter 3 of **Python for Noowbies**! 🎉 You’ve flipped coins and chosen paths in **Fork-Frenzy-Fiesta**—now it’s time to shine at the coding school festival by mastering **if** and **else** statements! You’ll use these to make decisions, like checking if a test score earns a gold star. Get ready to rock the grade book like a festival superstar! 🌟

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

- How **if** statements check conditions and run code when true.
- How **else** clauses handle the false case for two-way decisions.
- The importance of indentation and comparison operators in control flow.
- Create a grade checker to see who passes the festival test.

By the end, you’ll be a grade-checking guru, ready to ace any coding challenge! 📚

## 📋 What's Inside This Folder?

- **Examples**: A guide bursting with school-festival-themed examples to show how `if`/`else` statements work.
- **Exercises**: A grade-checking challenge to create a `grades.py` program that evaluates test scores.
- **Sample Code**: A Python file (`grades.py`) in the Exercises folder to boost your festival skills.

## 💡 Why If/Else Is Awesome

`if`/`else` statements are like the judges at a school festival—they decide who gets a prize based on the score! These statements let your programs make smart choices, perfect for apps, games, or quizzes. Let’s celebrate your coding skills and make decisions that sparkle! 🎈
