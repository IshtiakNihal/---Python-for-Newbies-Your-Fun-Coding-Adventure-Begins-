# 🧪 Chem Craze Carnival: Mix Potions with Relational Operators & Elif!

Welcome to the **Chem Craze Carnival**, the third stop in Chapter 3 of **Python for Noowbies**! 🎉 You’ve flipped coins and checked grades—now it’s time to brew some coding magic in the chemistry lab! With **relational operators** and **elif** statements, you’ll compare values and make multiple decisions, like testing potions to see if they fizz or glow. Grab your lab coat and let’s spark some chemical reactions! ⚗️

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

- How **relational operators** (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) compare values in conditions.
- Using **elif** statements to check multiple conditions in control flow.
- Why only one `if`/`elif`/`else` block runs, and how order matters.
- Create a pH tester to classify liquids in your coding lab.

By the end, you’ll be a potion-mixing pro, comparing and deciding like a chemistry champ! 🥼

## 📋 What's Inside This Folder?

- **Examples**: A guide bubbling with chemistry-lab-themed examples to show how relational operators and `elif` statements work.
- **Exercises**: A pH-testing challenge to create a `ph_levels.py` program that checks liquid properties.
- **Sample Code**: A Python file (`ph_levels.py`) in the Exercises folder to ignite your coding experiments.

## 💡 Why Relational Operators & Elif Rock

Relational operators are like your lab’s measuring tools—they compare numbers, strings, or variables to guide decisions. `elif` statements add extra choices, letting your program pick from many paths, like sorting potions by strength. These skills are key for games, quizzes, or science apps—let’s make your code fizz! 🧫

## 🛠️ How to Use This Folder

1. Bubble through the **Examples** to master relational operators and `elif`.
2. Mix it up in the **Exercises** to build your pH tester.
3. Try the extra challenges to remix your decision-making skills.
4. Run your code in VS Code, an online IDE, or any Python environment (see Gear Up for Coding Magic for setup help).
