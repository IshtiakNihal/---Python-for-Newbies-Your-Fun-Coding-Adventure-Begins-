# 🚘 Coin Flip Challenge: Take a Chance on the Code Highway!

It’s time to rev up for the **Fork Frenzy Fiesta**! 🎊 In this folder, you’ll create a `coin_flip.py` program that simulates a coin toss using `if`/`else` statements, giving you a 50/50 shot at two different paths. This challenge introduces control flow by letting your program decide between two outcomes, like choosing a road-trip route at a fork. Buckle up and let’s flip some coins! 🎲

## 📋 Instructions

Follow these steps to complete the main exercise and try the extra challenges. Use VS Code, an online IDE (like Replit), or any Python environment (check Gear Up for Coding Magic for setup help).

### Exercise 1: Simulate a Coin Flip

Your mission is to create a `coin_flip.py` program that:

- Uses `random.randint(0, 1)` to generate a random number (0 or 1).
- Prints “Heads” if the number is greater than 0.5, or “Tails” otherwise.
- Run it 5 times to see the random outcomes.

Here’s how to do it:

1. **Create a File**:
    
    - Open VS Code or your IDE.
    - Create a new file called `coin_flip.py` (use the sample file in this folder).
2. **Write the Code**:
    
    - Copy this exact code to simulate a coin toss:
        
        ```python
        import random
        num = random.randint(0, 1)   # Generates a random number that's either 0 or 1
        if num > 0.5:
            print('Heads')
        else:
            print('Tails')
        ```
        
    - Start with a comment, like:
        
        ```python
        # Flipping a coin on the code highway!
        ```
        
3. **Run the Program**:
    
    - In VS Code, click the “Run” triangle or right-click and select “Run Python File in Terminal”.
        
    - In an online IDE, hit the “Run” button.
        
    - In a terminal, navigate to the folder and run:
        
        ```bash
        python3 coin_flip.py
        ```
        
4. **Run It 5 Times**:
    
    - Run the program 5 separate times (e.g., press “Run” 5 times in VS Code).
    - Each run will print either “Heads” or “Tails” (≈50% chance for each).
    - Keep track of how many times you get “Heads” (e.g., 3 out of 5).

**Expected Output** (example of one run):

```
Heads
```

**Sample File**: Check out `coin_flip.py` in this folder for the code or use it to test.

**Share the Fun**: Save a screenshot of your 5 runs and share it with friends or post it on X with #PythonForNoowbies to show off your coin-flipping skills! Note how many times you got “Heads”!

**Answering Your Question**: You asked, “How many times did it go Heads?” Since I can’t run the program directly, I can’t give an exact count. However, since `random.randint(0, 1)` gives 0 or 1 with equal probability, and `num > 0.5` checks for 1, you’d expect ≈2–3 “Heads” in 5 runs (50% chance). Try running it 5 times and let me know your results!

### Exercise 2: Extra Challenges

Want to keep the fiesta rolling? Try these tasks! Create a new file (e.g., `my_control.py`) or edit `coin_flip.py`.

1. **Fancy Flip Report**:
    
    - Add a border to the output:
        
        ```python
        print("~~~ Coin Flip Result ~~~")
        print('Heads')
        print("~~~ Coin Flip Result ~~~")
        ```
        
2. **Track the Flip**:
    
    - Store the result in a variable and print it:
        
        ```python
        result = 'Heads' if num > 0.5 else 'Tails'
        print("You flipped:", result)
        ```
        
3. **Custom Decision**:
    
    - Replace the coin flip with a road-trip choice:
        
        ```python
        choice = random.randint(0, 1)
        if choice == 0:
            print("Turn left to the beach!")
        else:
            print("Turn right to the forest!")
        ```
        
4. **Input-Based Choice**:
    
    - Let the user choose a path:
        
        ```python
        direction = input("Type 'left' or 'right': ")
        if direction == 'left':
            print("You’re off to the city!")
        else:
            print("You’re headed to the countryside!")
        ```
        

## 💡 Tips for Control Flow Success

- **Check Indentation**: Code under `if`/`else` must be indented (4 spaces), or you’ll get a SyntaxError (see Bug Buster Bonanza).
- **Understand Random**: `random.randint(0, 1)` picks 0 or 1 randomly. The condition `num > 0.5` means 1 = “Heads”, 0 = “Tails”.
- **Run Multiple Times**: Each run is random, so results vary—try more than 5 runs for fun!
- **Test Both Paths**: In your own `if`/`else` code, test inputs that trigger both outcomes.

## 🎯 Did It Work?

- Did your `coin_flip.py` print “Heads” or “Tails” each run? If yes, you’re steering like a pro! 🌟
- If not, check for typos, ensure `random` is imported, and confirm Python is set up (see Gear Up for Coding Magic).
- How many “Heads” did you get in 5 runs? Share your count!
