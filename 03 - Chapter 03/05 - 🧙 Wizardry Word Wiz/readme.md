# 🧙 Wizardry Word Wiz: Sort Wizards with Control Flow!

Welcome to the **Wizardry Word Wiz**, the final stop in Chapter 3 of **Python for Noowbies**! 🎉 You’ve flipped coins, graded tests, mixed potions, won prizes, and ridden roller coasters—now it’s time to wield the magic of **control flow** to become a Hogwarts Sorting Hat! Using `if`, `elif`, `else`, relational, and logical operators, you’ll create a quiz to assign wizards to their houses. Grab your wand and let’s cast some coding spells! 🪄

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

- Recapping **control flow**: `if`, `elif`, `else`, relational operators (`==`, `>`, etc.), and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).
- Combining conditions to process user inputs and track scores.
- Using variables to store and update cumulative values (e.g., house points).
- Creating a Sorting Hat quiz to assign wizards to Hogwarts houses.

By the end, you’ll be a magical coding wizard, sorting students with enchanted logic! 🦁🦅🦡🐍

## 📋 What's Inside This Folder?

- **Examples**: A guide bursting with wizard-themed examples to show how control flow works together.
- **Exercises**: A Sorting Hat challenge to create a `sorting_hat.py` program that assigns Hogwarts houses.
- **Sample Code**: A Python file (`sorting_hat.py`) in the Exercises folder to fuel your magical skills.

## 💡 Why Control Flow Is Magical

Control flow is like a wizard’s spellbook—it directs your program’s magic to the right path! By combining `if`/`elif`/`else`, relational operators, and logical operators, you can make decisions, compare values, and combine conditions to create interactive programs like a Sorting Hat quiz. Let’s enchant the code! ✨

## 🛠️ How to Use This Folder

1. Cast a spell with the **Examples** to master control flow combinations.
2. Don the Sorting Hat in the **Exercises** to build your magical quiz.
3. Try the bonus challenge to find the top Hogwarts house.
4. Run your code in VS Code, an online IDE, or any Python environment (see Gear Up for Coding Magic for setup help).
