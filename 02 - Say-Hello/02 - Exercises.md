# 🏋️‍♂️ Exercises: Print Your First Python Program!

It’s time to get your hands dirty and write some Python code! 🎉 In this folder, you’ll create your very own "Hello World!" program using the `print()` function and try some fun challenges to practice. Let’s make Python talk!

## 📋 Instructions

Follow these steps to complete the main exercise and try the extra challenges. You can use VS Code, an online IDE (like Replit), or any Python environment (check the Setup-Guide if you need help).

### Exercise 1: Create Your Hello World Program

1. **Create a File**:
    
    - Open VS Code or your favorite IDE.
    - Create a new file and name it `hello_world.py` (you can use the sample file in this folder).
2. **Write the Code**:
    
    - Add this line to print "Hello World!":
        
        ```python
        print("Hello World!")
        ```
        
3. **Run the Program**:
    
    - In VS Code, click the "Run" triangle or right-click and select "Run Python File in Terminal".
        
    - In an online IDE, click the "Run" button.
        
    - In a terminal, navigate to the folder and run:
        
        ```bash
        python3 hello_world.py
        ```
        
4. **Check the Output**:
    
    - You should see:
        
        ```
        Hello World!
        ```
        
    - If you see this, congratulations—you’ve written your first Python program! 🎈
        

**Sample File**: Check out `hello_world.py` in this folder to see the code or use it directly.

### Exercise 2: Extra Challenges

Try these fun tasks to play with `print()`! Create a new file (e.g., `practice.py`) or edit `hello_world.py` for each one.

1. **Print Your Name**:
    
    - Write a `print()` statement to show your name. For example:
        
        ```python
        print("My name is Alice!")
        ```
        
    - Run it and see your name on the screen!
        
2. **Print a Greeting**:
    
    - Use `print()` to show a two-line message, like:
        
        ```python
        print("Hi, friend!")
        print("Welcome to Python!")
        ```
        
    - Try adding an empty `print()` between them for a blank line.
        
3. **Use Emojis**:
    
    - Create a `print()` statement with your favorite emojis. For example:
        
        ```python
        print("I love Python 🐍😄")
        ```
        
    - Find emojis online or copy them from the Examples.
        
4. **Tell a Mini Story**:
    
    - Use three `print()` statements to tell a short story. For example:
        
        ```python
        print("Once upon a time...")
        print("A coder learned Python.")
        print("And they built a game! 🎮")
        ```
        
    - Get creative with your own story!
        

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Save Your File**: Always save your `.py` file (Ctrl+S) before running it.
- **Check Quotes**: Make sure your quotes match (`'` or `"`). A mismatch like `print('Hello")` will cause an error.
- **Experiment**: Change the text in `print()` and run the code to see what happens.
- **Ask for Help**: If you get stuck, check the Examples or ask on a Python community like r/learnpython.

## 🎯 Did It Work?

- Were you able to print "Hello World!" in the terminal? If yes, you’re officially a Python coder! 🚀
- If not, double-check your code, ensure Python is installed (see Setup-Guide), and try again.

## ❓ Need Help?

If anything’s unclear or you hit a snag, don’t worry! **Leave a comment** on this GitHub page or **join our Discord community** (link in the repo description) to get help from other learners and coders.

## 🛠️ What’s Next?

You’ve just made Python say "Hello World!" and played with `print()`. Awesome job! 🌟 Head back to the Hello World README to review what you’ve learned, or move on to the next topic in the main Learn-Python-From-Scratch README when it’s ready.

**Super Challenge**: Can you print a message with your name and an emoji in one line? Try it and show off your skills!
