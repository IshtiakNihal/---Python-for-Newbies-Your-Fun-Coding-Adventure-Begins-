# 🌡️ Math Magic Challenge: Convert Brooklyn’s Temperature!

It’s time to work your wizardry in the **Math Magic Mix**! 🪄 In this folder, you’ll create a `temperature.py` program that converts the current temperature in Brooklyn, NY (home of Codédex), from Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C) using arithmetic operators. You’ll use the formula `Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8` to cast a spell that keeps your coding cool. Let’s crunch those numbers! 🎶

## 📋 Instructions

Follow these steps to complete the main exercise and try the extra challenges. Use VS Code, an online IDE (like Replit), or any Python environment (check Gear Up for Coding Magic for setup help).

### Exercise 1: Convert Brooklyn’s Temperature

Your mission is to create a `temperature.py` program that converts Brooklyn’s current temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Based on recent weather data, Brooklyn’s temperature on April 18, 2025, is around **48°F**. Use the formula:

```
Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8
```

Here’s how to do it:

1. **Create a File**:
    
    - Open VS Code or your IDE.
    - Create a new file called `temperature.py` (you can use the sample file in this folder).
2. **Write the Code**:
    
    - Start with a comment to set the vibe, like:
        
        ```python
        # Converting Brooklyn's weather to Celsius!
        ```
        
    - Create a variable for the Fahrenheit temperature, apply the formula, and print the result. For example:
        
        ```python
        # Converting Brooklyn's weather to Celsius!
        fahrenheit = 48
        celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8
        print("Brooklyn's temperature:", celsius, "°C")
        ```
        
3. **Run the Program**:
    
    - In VS Code, click the “Run” triangle or right-click and select “Run Python File in Terminal”.
        
    - In an online IDE, hit the “Run” button.
        
    - In a terminal, navigate to the folder and run:
        
        ```bash
        python3 temperature.py
        ```
        
4. **Check the Output**:
    
    - Your output should show the temperature in Celsius, like:
        
        ```
        Brooklyn's temperature: 8.88888888888889 °C
        ```
        
    - If it looks odd, check your formula or add a comment to explain your math.
        

**Sample File**: Check out `temperature.py` in this folder for an example or use it to test.

**Share the Magic**: Save a screenshot of your temperature output and share it with friends or post it on X with #PythonForNoowbies to show off your wizardry

### Exercise 2: Extra Challenges

Ready to amplify your math magic? Try these fun tasks! Create a new file (e.g., `my_operators.py`) or edit `temperature.py` for each one.

1. **Fancy Weather Report**:
    
    - Add a border to your output, like:
        
        ```
        ~~~ Weather Wizard ~~~
        Brooklyn's temperature: 8.88888888888889 °C
        ~~~ Weather Wizard ~~~
        ```
        
    - Use `print()` to add borders above and below.
        
2. **Round the Result**:
    
    - Round the Celsius temperature to 2 decimal places using `round()`:
        
        ```python
        celsius = round((fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8, 2)
        print("Brooklyn's temperature:", celsius, "°C")  # Output: 8.89 °C
        ```
        
3. **Disco Snack Bill**:
    
    - Calculate the total and tip for disco snacks, like:
        
        ```python
        nachos = 4.99
        soda = 1.49
        total = nachos + soda
        tip = total * 0.2
        print("Total with tip:", total + tip)
        ```
        
4. **Modulo Party Planner**:
    
    - Use `%` to check if guests fit evenly at tables:
        
        ```python
        guests = 14
        tables = 3
        leftover = guests % tables
        print("Guests per table:", guests // tables, "Leftover:", leftover)
        ```
        

## 💡 Tips for Math Mastery

- **Use Parentheses**: Wrap calculations like `(fahrenheit - 32)` to ensure the right order.
- **Comment Your Math**: Add comments like `# Subtract 32 first` to explain your steps.
- **Test Small**: Try your formula with known values (e.g., 32°F = 0°C) to check accuracy.
- **Have Fun**: Add silly variable names or emojis to make your code pop!

## 🎯 Did It Work?

- Did your `temperature.py` print Brooklyn’s temperature in Celsius? If yes, you’re a math wizard! 🌟
- If not, check your formula, ensure Python is set up (see Gear Up for Coding Magic), and try again.
