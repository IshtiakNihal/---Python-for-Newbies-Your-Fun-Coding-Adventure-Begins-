# üéµ Math Magic Mix: Operators That Make Numbers Dance!

Welcome to the **Math Magic Mix**, where arithmetic operators turn your Python code into a number-crunching fiesta! üßÆ In Data Type Disco, you learned how to store data in variables‚Äînow we‚Äôll use operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` to make those numbers boogie. From adding up party snacks to dividing dance floor space, these operators are your magic wand for calculations. Let‚Äôs spin some math spells! ‚ú®

## üìñ What Are Arithmetic Operators?

Arithmetic operators are Python‚Äôs tools for doing math with numbers (integers and floats). They take variables or values, crunch them, and give you a result. Here‚Äôs the lineup:

- `+` **Addition**: Adds numbers together.
- `-` **Subtraction**: Subtracts one number from another.
- `*` **Multiplication**: Multiplies numbers.
- `/` **Division**: Divides one number by another (gives a float).
- `%` **Modulo**: Returns the remainder after division.

You can use these with variables from Data Type Disco to calculate anything!

### Example 1: Playing with Operators

```python
# Setting up my disco budget
snacks = 5  # Number of snacks
cost_per_snack = 2.5  # Cost in dollars (float)

# Using operators
total_cost = snacks * cost_per_snack  # Multiply
tax = total_cost * 0.1  # 10% tax
final_bill = total_cost + tax  # Add tax
savings = 20 - final_bill  # Subtract from budget

print("Total Cost:", total_cost)  # Output: Total Cost: 12.5
print("Tax:", tax)                # Output: Tax: 1.25
print("Final Bill:", final_bill)  # Output: Final Bill: 13.75
print("Savings:", savings)        # Output: Savings: 6.25
```

Here, we multiply, add, and subtract to manage a disco budget, using integers (`snacks`) and floats (`cost_per_snack`).

### Example 2: Division and Modulo

The `/` operator gives a float result, and `%` finds what‚Äôs left over after division‚Äîperfect for splitting things evenly!

```python
# Splitting disco lights
total_lights = 17
lights_per_wall = total_lights / 4  # Divide by 4 walls
leftover_lights = total_lights % 4  # Remainder

print("Lights per wall:", lights_per_wall)  # Output: Lights per wall: 4.25
print("Leftover lights:", leftover_lights)  # Output: Leftover lights: 1
```

**Knowledge Nugget**: Modulo (`%`) is super useful in coding! It‚Äôs used to check if a number is even (`number % 2 == 0`), loop through items in games, or split tasks evenly in apps.

## üéØ Order of Operations: Parentheses Rule!

Python follows math rules for which operation comes first, called **precedence**. Parentheses `()` have the highest priority, so use them to control the order.

### Example 3: Using Parentheses

```python
# Calculating a party tip
drinks = 3.99
popcorn = 1.99

# Without parentheses
wrong_tip = drinks + popcorn * 0.15  # Multiplies first, then adds
print("Wrong Tip:", wrong_tip)        # Output: Wrong Tip: 4.2875

# With parentheses
correct_tip = (drinks + popcorn) * 0.15  # Adds first, then multiplies
print("Correct Tip:", correct_tip)       # Output: Correct Tip: 0.8925
```

**Fun Fact**: The order of operations follows PEMDAS: **P**arentheses, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication/**D**ivision (left to right), **A**ddition/**S**ubtraction (left to right). Parentheses let you override this, making your math crystal clear!

## üí° Tips for Math Magic

- **Use Clear Names**: Name variables like `total_cost` or `dance_budget` to keep track of your math.
- **Mix Data Types**: Operators work with integers and floats‚Äîdivision (`/`) always returns a float!
- **Test Your Math**: Run your code often to check if your calculations match your expectations.
- **Explore Modulo**: Try `%` for fun tasks, like checking if a party guest list is divisible by table sizes.

You‚Äôre ready to cast some serious math spells! Head to the Exercises folder to create a `temperature.py` program that converts Brooklyn‚Äôs temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Let‚Äôs keep the magic flowing! üå°Ô∏è

**Quick Challenge**: What‚Äôs the output of this code?

```python
budget = 10
cost = 7.5
remaining = budget - cost
print(remaining)
```

Try it in the exercises!
