# 🎤 Chatty Code Craze: Talk to Your Program!

Welcome to the **Chatty Code Craze**, where we’re turning the **Python for Noowbies** stage into a lively talk show in Chapter 2! 🎉 After powering up with exponents in Power-Up Punch, you’re ready to make your programs _talk back_ using the `input()` function and `int()` for numbers. From chatting with users to calculating triangle sides, this topic will make your code as interactive as a game show! 🎮

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

- How to use `input()` to get text from users, like names or answers.
- How to convert text to numbers with `int()` for math magic.
- Why user input makes your programs fun and dynamic, like apps or games.
- Create a program to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle, channeling ancient Greek math vibes!

By the end, you’ll be hosting a coding talk show where users call the shots! 🎤

## 📋 What's Inside This Folder?

- **Examples**: A guide packed with lively examples to show how `input()` and `int()` work, plus tips to keep your chat flowing.
- **Exercises**: A geometry challenge to create a `hypotenuse.py` program that calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
- **Sample Code**: A Python file (`hypotenuse.py`) in the Exercises folder to spark your chatty skills.

## 💡 Why Input Is Awesome

User input is like inviting your audience to join the show—it makes your programs interactive and fun! Whether you’re building a quiz app, a game, or a calculator, `input()` lets users add their own flair. Let’s get chatting! 🎸
