# 💃 Data Type Disco: Groove with Python’s Data!

Welcome to the **Data Type Disco**, the grooviest stop in **Python for Noowbies** Chapter 2! 🎶 You’ve rocked Chapter 1, making Python chat and drawing epic patterns—now it’s time to boogie with **variables** and **data types**! Think of variables as your dance floor’s treasure chests, holding sparkly data like numbers, text, and true/false vibes. Get ready to spin integers, twirl floats, jive with strings, and moonwalk with Booleans! 🕺

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

- How to use **variables** to store and change data like a coding DJ.
- The fab four data types: **integers** (whole numbers), **floats** (decimals), **strings** (text), and **Booleans** (true/false).
- Why data types are the beat of every Python program.
- How to mix data types to create a funky profile card that screams YOU!

By the end, you’ll be the star of the data dance floor, ready to store and show off your coding moves! ✨

## 📋 What's Inside This Folder?

- **Examples**: A guide with dazzling examples to show how variables and data types work, plus tips to keep your code in rhythm.
- **Exercises**: A dance-off challenge to create your own `datatypes.py` program, building a profile card with variables and data types.
- **Sample Code**: A Python file (`datatypes.py`) in the Exercises folder to inspire your moves.

## 💡 Why Data Types Rock

Variables and data types are like the instruments in your coding band—they let you store and play with all kinds of data! Whether you’re counting disco balls (integers), measuring dance floor lengths (floats), writing song lyrics (strings), or checking if the party’s on (Booleans), data types make your code sing. Let’s hit the dance floor! 🎸
